Число таких фильмов не очень велико. При построении гистограммы такие фильмы на ней не были видны. Поэтому при построении гистограммы использовались только фильмы, находящиеся между 10-м и 90-м процентилем. На гистограмме видно, что большое количество фильмов имеют доход до \\$5M. С ростом дохода фильмов, количество таких фильмов убывает. Можно предположить, что количество фильмов с некоторым доходом обратно пропорционально доходу."

Остальные фильмы имеют меньшую продолжительность. Причём значения между 150 мин. и 250 мин. - это выбросы, число таких фильмов не очень велико. Видно, что разброс данных по этому признаку не очень большой. При построении гистограммы были проанализированы фильмы с продолжительностью от 80 мин. до 144 мин. Такие пределы были выбраны, для большей наглядности. Видно, что большинство фильмов имеют продолжительность около 95 мин. Фильмов с меньшей и большей продолжительностью меньше. Причём количество фильмов быстрее спадает при уменьшении продолжительности, чем при её увеличении."

        "4. Столбачатая диаграмма показывает, что большинство фильмов в данном списке имеет режиссёр Woody Allen, далее идут остальные режиссёры. Сначала разница по количеству фильмов меняется больше между соседними режиссёрами, но далее каждый следующий режиссёр имеет в списке почти столько же фильмов сколько и предыдущий. Круговая диаграмма показывает топ 5 самых производительных режиссёров. Среди них почти четверть всех фильмов снял Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood и Steven Spielberg сняли одинаковое число фильмов. Далее чуть меньше сняли Alfred Hitchcock и Ridley Scott. В целом из графического анализа видно, что малое количество режиссёров сняло много фильмов из этого списка, а основное количество режиссёров имеет небольшое количество фильмов."

Поэтому у режиссёров, которые выпускали фильмы до изменения системы рейтингов и после, есть разные категории, которые могут обозначать примерно одну и ту же возрастную оценку для фильма.\n",
        "1. Из диаграмм видно, что у всех режиссёров фильмы с категориями 18 и X в меньшинстве. Самые распространённые категории: 15 и 12A. Это касается всех режиссёров кроме Альфреда Хичкока, у него больше всего фильмов имеют категорию A. Скорее всего это связано с тем, что он снимал кино раньше остальных режиссёров, и в те времена система оценок отличалась от современной. Категория U не представлена ни у кого из режиссёров на данных диаграммах, кроме Стивена Спилберга, но она занимает у него малую часть. Для разных режиссёров распределение категорий довольно разное. У Вуди Аллена и Стивена Спилберга это распределение более равномерное, для остальных режиссёров есть предпочтительные категории.\n",

У данного режиссёра самая большая доля фильмов с категорией PG, чем у остальных. И в целом фильмы пригодны для просмотра для более молодой аудитории, чем у остальных.\n",
        "\n",
        "Альфред Хичкок: большинство фильмов имеют категорию A. Ни у кого из остальных режиссёров эта категория не является доминирующей. Это связано с тем, что Альфред Хичкок снимал фильмы, когда система оценивания возрастного рейтинга была другая. Также существенную часть составляют фильмы с категорией PG. Есть некоторое количество фильмов для взрослой аудитории(18, X). У данного режиссёра наименьшая доля фильмов с рейтингом 15. Это также может быть связано с тем, что такой категории не было в период в основной работы режиссёра.\n",

Это связано с тем, что это примерно одни и те же категории, но существовашие в разное время. Также схожесть имеют категории PG, 12, 12A, у них у всех примерно одинаковая медиана, но разброс данных немного различается. Есть схожие категории 15 и A. Категория U отличается от других категорий наибольшим разбросом. Таким образом, видно, что есть связь между категорией фильма и его доходом. Но для некоторых категорий, например U это связь не очень явная, так как существует большой разброс. У категорий также различается количество и величина выбросов. Для фильмов категорий 18, X количество и величина выбросов не такое большое как для других. Самые большие выбросы и их количество у категорий 15, 12A, PG\n",

Медианная продолжительность - 106мин. Медианный рейтинг 6.8. Эти показатели говорят о том, что в выборке собраны фильмы в основном с довольно высоким рейтингом и хорошими доходами. Топ 5 режиссёров, которые сняли больше всего фильмов: Стивен Спилберг, Ридли Скотт, Клинт Иствуд, Вуди Аллен, Альфред Хичкок. У каждого режиссёра разное количество фильмов, сятое в каждом классе. Но в остальных признаках, таких как продолжительность и доход, режиссёры Альфред Хичкок и Вуди Аллен довольно похожи, и существенно различаются от остальных режиссёров. Самый распространённый класс фильмов - 15. Самые высокорейтинговые и прибыльные фильмы в основном это фильмы класса U. Они же являются наименее продолжительными среди остальных классов. Наименее прибыльными являются фильмы класса 18 и X для взрослой аудитории. Явной зависимости между рейтингом фильма и количеством заработанных денег нет, но для фильмов с высоким рейтингом больше выбросов, что значит вероятяность получить высокий доход больше, но не гарантирована. В среднем фильмы с более высоким рейтингом более продолжительны, но для более Не было найдено явной зависимости между продолжительностью фильма и его доходом. Но вероятность получить высокий доход у очень коротких или длинных фильмов маленькая."
